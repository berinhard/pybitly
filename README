pybitly is a tool to consume the Bit.ly API.

The objectve of this project is to create a client to the Bit.ly API. It already exists a Python project to serve as such a client. But, there is no command line usage. It's just a Python module that you can use it to consume the API inside your project. Besides that, I'm using this project to practise, get more confident with Python programming and learn more about it.
